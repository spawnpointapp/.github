Howdy there! Fancy seeing you here partner! I assume you'll be here to try and look through our source code? Maybe audit? stuff like that? if so, you've come to the right place! in here we will be posting the code that is used for spawnpoint (We will have private clones but these will only be for production purposes, both will share the same code but the production repos are for storing code that contains server keys/auth keys that aren't meant for the public, keep that in mind).

But that said! check out our repos in the repositories tab and have a great day!
